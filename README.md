## Project Statement

AAL is a well-known clothing brand in Australia, operating in the clothing business since 2000. The company caters to a diverse customer base, including kids, women, men, and seniors, and has branches in various states and cities across Australia. With a booming business and plans for expansion, AAL aims to gain a comprehensive understanding of its sales data to support future investment decisions. The CEO has entrusted the Head of Sales and Marketing (S&M) with the following objectives:

1. Identify the states generating the highest revenues.
2. Develop sales programs for states with lower revenues.

As a data scientist, your task is to analyze AAL's sales data for the fourth quarter across Australia, both at a national and state level, and provide insights to help the company make data-driven decisions for the coming year. You will be working with the enclosed CSV file, "AusApparelSales4thQrt2020.csv," which contains the relevant sales data.
